Node.js is probably **THE most popular** and modern server-side programming language you can dive into these days!

Node.js developers are in high demand and the language is used for everything from traditional web apps with **server-side rendered views** over **REST APIs** all the way up to **GraphQL APIs** and **real-time web services**. Not to mention its applications in build workflows for projects of all sizes.
